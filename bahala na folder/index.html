          <p>I find that I can only recall long-term memories if
            they are important to me, or if they are dramatic experiences.
            A few examples of my childhood memories are my mother reading
            to me, my grandfather playing his guitar, and my dad relentlessly
            teaching me how to ice skate, no matter how many times I fell.
            The people who affect my social life the most are my family and friends.
            I have an extremely close family that has played a major role in my life.
            They are whom I spend most of my spare time with. My family usually
            gathers every weekend for dinner. I am also very open to different religions,
            cultures, and practices because I know many people with different backgrounds
            and beliefs. </p>

          <p>No one can’t meet a family like mine’s. My family is well diversified.
            Every family member plays an important role in all my family’s lives.
            In my family, there are four people: my father, my mother, my little
            brother and me. My father is one who brings money home and is also
            responsible for organizing and planning family trips. My mother is the
            one who is in charge for making meals and makes sure everyone eats at
            the appropriate times. My little brother is the pet of the family. He
            actually doesn’t have any responsibilities, for he’s the pet. I am the
            rock of support in my family. I always go beyond my parents’ expectations.
            I also support my younger cousins and little brother, by being a role model
            that they can look up to.Doing what my parents tell me to do is just one of
            many reasons why I am a rock of support for my family. Not only do I support
            my parents, but I also support my younger cousins and brother. As an eldest
            brother and cousin, I feel I must be a good example for the young ones. There
            are numerous methods of showing my cousins and brother support. One main
            way is by providing advice on making the right choices. For example my
            brother had a problem at school with one of his classmates.</p>

          <p>Have you ever had someone in your life who helped you figure out who you
            were? Someone who showed you the right path. Someone who was there right
            next you even if you did not take that path. Someone who always seemed to
            be right, but never held it against you when you were not. Someone whom
            without your life would most likely be entirely different. I have. Her name
            was Mary Grace. Mary Grace was more than my neighbor. She was more than my mentor.
            She was my best friend. Mary Grace lived three houses down from me when I moved
            into a new neighborhood. She made moving to a new neighborhood a lot easier.
            She was one of those people who was friends with everybody. She was friends
            with everyone because she was so special.</p>

          <p>I grew up in a Christian family, so I was surrounded by God and the church
            from the very beginning. I was raised in a Christian home, but just followed
            through the motions of doing “Christian things” that I thought you were supposed
            to do. I didn’t know Him, I just knew about Him. I found myself searching for
            purpose and meaning in people and also in myself. Whether that was my friends
            or in relationships, I poured my whole heart into them. I also became very fixated
            on myself and my image. I became very consumed with what people thought of me and was
            living for the acceptance of the world.</p>

          <p><b style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Badminton</b> is my favorite sport because playing it makes me stay active throughout the day.
             requires speed, strength, and precision. To become a good player she needs to practice frequently.
             When I play badminton with my friends, I feel energetic throughout the day. Playing badminton feeds
             my body with the much needed energy to help me go through each day. Badminton is an interesting game because
             every time I play, there is some anxiety and excitement in the end. At the end of the game, there has to be a winner,
             this mekes the battle more exciting. </p>
